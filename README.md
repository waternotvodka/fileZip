# fileZip

A programme for zipping together two files.

I can't think of a single use for this, except it's kinda funny to stitch files together.

It's not concatenation it zips the files together character by character, zip a file against itself to double the occurence of each letter.

file1 = "abc": zip file1 file1 output => output = "aabbcc"

Usage: ./prog [file1] [file2] [outputFile]
